...Without a single line of JavaScript.**

[JQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com) is a client-side JavaScript 
library that provides support for mobile web development. The best of 
it is that you can target any of the following platforms:

  * iOS
  * Android
  * BlackBerry
  * Bada
  * Windows Phone
  * Palm Web OS
  * Symbian
  * Meego

With the jQuery Mobile Extension you can develop WebSharper
applications that use the jQuery Mobile Extension API using nothing
but F# code.
